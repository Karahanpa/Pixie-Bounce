# Pixie Bounce
- This is a very simple game I made all on my own in Unity. All the assets in the game are taken from https://kenney.nl/.  The game is a basic 2D platformer. It includes a timer and score tracker so you can see how you did at the end of the game. It also features a pausing feature with pause screen.
